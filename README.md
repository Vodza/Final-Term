Caro - Final term Java

Setup instructions:
- Install mysql, IDE 
- Add database src/Server/DB/carodb.sql to mysql, name the database "carodb"
- Run Server src/Server/RunServer.java will run at port 5056 by default
- Run Client src/Client/RunClient.java
- The Connect Server interface appears. Enter the IP and port to the Server (by default I have already recorded the local server ip)
- Press Connect and Play

Remember to install the Mysql Connector library into the source code if you do not want to log in correctly but the server does not receive it

You can watch the demo video below to see the interface and how to run the program

The program still has some functions that are not yet available such as creating rooms, entering rooms, new games or re-playing (possibly in the future XD)
